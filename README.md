RFControl: Karlstad implementation
==================================

This is a fork of [Pimatic RFControl](https://github.com/pimatic/RFControl) that contains a different baseband decoder. It is better at capturing messages in noisy conditions, will capture messages with non-geometric pulse times and is capable of capturing chained messages.
